If you want to run the app as an admin (to see the car and users list), use the following account:

Username : AdminAccount

password : admin123

# How to run the app
First of all, make sure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) installed into your system. 

After cloning the repos, open terminal and enter the "car_rental_app" which is inside the "frontend" repos. 
```
cd frontend
cd car_rental_app
```
Install the necessary npm package:
```
npm install
```

Also, install the jwt decode library (or else you can run into some bugs)

```
npm install jwt-decode
```
You can run the react app, open the localhost shown in terminal (http://localhost:3000/)
```
npm run start
```
You will then be able to run front end application on a local host. 

To run the back end application, go back into the originial repos (Orion-soen341projectW2024), then open the api repos :
```
cd ..
cd ..
cd api
```

Now make sure you have npm installed, and again start the server:
```
npm install
```
Now, run the backend server.
```
npm run start
```
